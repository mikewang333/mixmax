# mixmax
Playing around with MixMax (gmail extension) API using Node to create a /news command and a spotify link resolver in an email.
The /news command calls NY Times API to generate search results for a given topic and the spotify link resolver 
embeds a spotify player all in an email (unforunately the spotify player can't be sent over web because it is an iframe 
that has gmail security risks).

Spotify player embedded into email:
